# webdev_lab1
used in 2025 summer semester

This repository was created for the first lab assignment of lesson 2 of the Fundamentals of Web Development course offered by Illinois Tech.

The first task is to create a repository on GitHub, push my first HTML code for this course, and publish a very simple web page. It's just to test how it works.
